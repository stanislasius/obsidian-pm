## [Unreleased]

### Added

- Copy the task ID or file path to the clipboard by clicking the corresponding header or footer text in the task editor

### Changed

- Design overhaul of the task modal, with improved UX and unified components
- Status, priority, type, and dates on a task are now changed via a value picker
- Tags, assignees, and dependencies are edited through a new searchable picker
- Repeat and dependencies are hidden by default and added to a task on demand from an "Add property" menu
- Archive, delete, and opening a task as a note are grouped under a single menu in the task editor
- Subtask progress is calculated only from completed subtasks
- Assignee avatars stack when more than one person is assigned
- Checkbox style now matches the one on the task table
- Task priority is shown with a colored chevron instead of a dot
- A value picker in the task editor sizes to its options instead of a fixed width
- Tags in the task table and on kanban cards show a colored dot, matching the task editor
- Logged time is shown the same way in the task table and on kanban cards

### Fixed

- The task editor's priority strip is now displayed along the top edge of the window
- The task editor title showed an input background when hovered or focused
- Time tracking shows the over-estimate state once logged time passes the estimate

## [1.6.3] - 2026-06-17

### Fixed

- The project view was empty when Pane Relief or Hover Editor was enabled ([#80](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/80))

## [1.6.2] - 2026-06-17

### Changed

- Task note filenames keep more of the task title before shortening

### Fixed

- Subtasks added in the task editor were lost on reload ([#90](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/90))
- The app froze when duplicating a task with a long title
- The project list showed stale task counts until the view was reopened ([#121](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/121))

## [1.6.1] - 2026-06-15

### Changed

- Task and project modals follow Obsidian's native border, shadow, and corner styling
- Status, priority, and tag labels follow Obsidian's native styling
- The accent color follows the Obsidian theme
- Gantt elements follow the Obsidian theme: the today marker, the milestone and subtask buttons, and the row selection and hover highlights
- Kanban cards align the assignee and due date to the bottom of the card

### Fixed

- Subtasks created from the subtasks list or the add-subtask buttons were not set to the subtask type ([#82](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/82))
- An assignee written as a note link (`[[People/Jane Doe]]`) showed the link path on its avatar instead of the person's name ([#64](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/64))

## [1.6.0] - 2026-06-12

### Added

- Completing a task records a completion date that can be edited in the task modal ([#93](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/93))
- Setting "Show description preview on board" (default off) shows the first three lines of each task's description on its kanban card ([#59](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/59))

### Changed

- Saving a task updates only the affected task notes instead of every note in the project
- Projects open faster, and reopening a project is instant. Edits made outside the plugin are still detected and reloaded
- The table stays responsive in large projects
- Views update in place after an edit, keeping the scroll position and selection
- Select all in the table selects every task matching the current filter, not just the visible rows
- Collapsing or expanding a subtree no longer changes any task notes
- The expand/collapse subtasks toggle looks the same in the table and Gantt views
- Gantt task bars show stronger contrast between completed and remaining work ([#87](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/87))
- Gantt task bars no longer show a stripe on tasks that have subtasks

### Fixed

- Images pasted or dropped onto a task were saved to the vault root instead of the task's own folder. The folder follows the task when it is renamed or archived, and is removed with the task
- Duplicating a task with its subtasks failed with a "note already exists" error and dropped the subtasks ([#90](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/90))
- Progress bar labels showed 0% instead of the actual value in some views
- The subtasks toggle did not respond in the Gantt view

## [1.5.0] - 2026-05-25

### Added

- Setting "Save tasks on close" (default on). When off, closing the task modal by X or click-outside discards edits, so only the Save button keeps them ([#62](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/62))
- "Open as note" button in the task modal header opens the task's note in a new tab
- Pasting a screenshot or dragging a file onto the task description saves it to the vault attachments folder and embeds it at the cursor
- Search box, filters (status, priority, assignee, tag, due date, archived), and saved views appear above every view, not just the table
- Filter state persists per project across plugin reloads
- Saved views remember the view mode they were created in, and selecting one switches the project to that mode
- Gantt lifts a matching task to the top level when its parent is filtered out, so search reveals deeply nested matches
- Release artifacts carry GitHub build provenance attestations; `gh attestation verify <file> --owner StepanKropachev` confirms a download was built from this repo

### Changed

- The UI follows the Obsidian theme: accent color, near and overdue colors, badges, and avatars
- Toolbar, Gantt, filter, and bulk-action buttons render at Obsidian's native size
- Saved-view tabs match the styling of the filter pills
- The "save view" and inline add buttons render as native Obsidian buttons
- Status and priority badges in the task modal are no longer keyboard-focusable
- The delete confirmation uses Obsidian's native warning style
- Primary buttons in light theme use a solid accent fill
- The project header gear, bulk-action clear, remove, and table row buttons use Obsidian's icons
- Remove buttons on tags, assignees, and dependencies turn red on hover
- Project-card and kanban-card progress bars are 3px tall
- The filter row collapses when no filters are active, and the Filter pill expands it
- Toggling a filter pill no longer moves focus out of the search box
- Gantt milestone labels and dependency arrows follow the active filter
- View switcher buttons show only an icon
- Assignee avatar initials use the first letter of the first two words, so "Michael Jordan" shows "MJ" instead of "MI"
- New task notes are named after the task title. Existing notes keep their name until the task is renamed

### Removed

- The Gantt "Hide completed" button; the Status filter excludes Done and Cancelled instead, and existing settings migrate automatically
- The inline quick-add input above the table; the toolbar "add task" button opens the task modal instead

### Fixed

- A solo avatar had extra spacing on its right in the project edit modal
- Kanban cards dropped the fourth and later assignees
- Duplicate task entries appeared when creating a task
- A saved-view pill stayed highlighted after its filter was changed
- An assignee stored as a wiki link (`[[Wiki Link]]`) showed garbled avatar initials ([#64](https://github.com/StepanKropachev/obsidian-pm/issues/64))
- Renaming a task to a title already used by another note shows an inline error instead of failing silently

## [1.4.0] - 2026-04-29

### Added

- Duplicate task action in the table and Kanban context menus
- "Open current file as project" command

### Fixed

- "Today" rolled over in the evening west of UTC
- Clicking a project from a task tab hijacked the tab
- Opening a project created duplicate tabs
- The ribbon button opened a duplicate project list pane
- The table scroll position was lost across opening and closing the task modal
- Project folders errored on case-insensitive vaults

### Fixed

- Undo for Gantt drag operations (Ctrl/Cmd+Z)

- Orphaned subtasks reattach to their parent on load
- Orphaned tasks are remapped when a custom status is deleted

- Type `[[` in the description field to link vault notes

### Changed

- The dependency picker filters out cycles
- Cross-links to canvases and databases work in task descriptions
- Bulk checkboxes stay hidden until the row is hovered
- Task modal buttons show the Shift+Enter shortcut hint

### Fixed

- Dependent tasks lost a day on each reschedule
- The Gantt scroll position was lost on re-render
- The import modal wrote tasks to the wrong folder
- Subtasks did not render when added through the parent task modal
- Deleting dependent tasks crashed the plugin
- The task modal jumped while typing long descriptions
- Import modal checkboxes responded slowly and double-toggled
