Table views, Gantt charts, Kanban boards, custom fields, time tracking, smart scheduling — all stored as plain Markdown with YAML frontmatter. No external services. No sync subscriptions. Your data stays yours.

## What's inside

- **Plain-text data** — Projects and tasks live as `.md` files in your vault. Portable, searchable, version-controllable. No lock-in, ever.
- **Three powerful views** — Table, Gantt, and Kanban. Switch freely; same data, different lenses.
- **Real project management** — Not just checkboxes. Dependencies, milestones, subtasks, time tracking, recurring tasks, smart scheduling, bulk actions.
- **Customizable everything** — Custom fields, statuses, priorities, saved views — adapt the tool to your workflow, not the other way around.
- **Works offline** — No cloud, no API calls, no accounts. Just Obsidian.

## Views

### Table

Sortable, filterable task grid with inline editing. Save custom filter/sort combinations as named views. Quick-add tasks from the top bar. Select multiple tasks and apply bulk actions — change status, priority, assignee, or delete in one move.

### Gantt

Interactive timeline with draggable bars, resizable edges, and dependency arrows. Zoom from day to quarter. Drag to reschedule, resize to adjust duration. Milestones render as diamonds. A "today" line keeps you oriented.

### Kanban

Card-based board grouped by status. Drag cards between columns to update status instantly. Cards show priority, assignees, and tags at a glance.

## Features

### Task management
- **Subtasks** — Nest tasks to any depth. Collapse/expand hierarchies across all views.
- **Dependencies** — Link blocking/dependent tasks. Visualized as arrows on the Gantt chart.
- **Milestones** — Zero-duration tasks for key dates and deliverables.
- **Archive** — Archive completed tasks without deleting. Toggle visibility at any time.

### Scheduling & time
- **Drag-and-drop scheduling** — Reschedule tasks by dragging bars on the Gantt chart.
- **Smart scheduling** — Auto-adjust dependent task dates when a blocker's dates change. Cycle detection prevents circular dependencies.
- **Recurring tasks** — Daily, weekly, monthly, or yearly recurrence with configurable end dates.
- **Time estimates & logging** — Set estimated hours, log actual time with date and notes. Visual progress bar shows logged vs. estimated.
- **Due date notifications** — Get reminders before tasks are due. Configurable lead time.

### Customization
- **Custom fields** — Add per-project fields: text, number, date, select, multi-select, person, checkbox, URL.
- **Custom statuses & priorities** — Edit labels, colors, and icons for each status and priority level.
- **Saved views** — Save filter/sort combinations in Table view and switch between them instantly.
- **Team roster** — Manage a global team list for assignment across all projects, plus per-project team members.

### Bulk operations
- Multi-select tasks in Table view for batch actions:
  - Set status, priority, assignee, tag, or due date
  - Adjust progress
  - Archive/unarchive
  - Set a parent task
  - Delete

### Import
You can add any existing note from your vault to project as a task. Run **Project Manager: Import notes as tasks** in the Command Palette, pick a project, select files, then choose default status, default priority, and whether to **move** files into the task folder or **copy** them. Already-imported notes are skipped.

- If a project view is open, import auto-targets that project (no picker shown).
- If no project view is open, a project picker appears first, then the import modal.

You can also create a project from a note. Add `pm-project: true` to any note's frontmatter, then run **Open current file as project**.


## Collaboration over the Project

The vault is the database. Anything that syncs your vault syncs your projects.

**Git** works well. Commit your projects folder, push, pull. Sync conflicts show up as regular Markdown conflicts. Resolve them like any other file.
**Obsidian Sync, iCloud, Dropbox, Syncthing** all work without extra setup.

For teams:

- Add people in **Settings > Team members**, or to a project's own member list from the project modal.
- Assign tasks via the Assignees field. Filter by assignee in the Table view.
- Notifications are local. Each person sees their own due date reminders.

There is no real-time multi-user editing. Two people editing the same task at once produces a sync conflict, same as any Markdown note.

## Contributing

I appreciate community interest in the project! However, since this plugin is maintained by one person in their spare time, I have strict rules to keep the codebase clean, stable, and manageable. 

If you want to contribute, please follow these rules:

1. **Open an Issue first:** Do not submit a Pull Request for new features, architecture changes, or major refactoring without discussing it in an issue first. Uncoordinated PRs will be closed.
2. **No AI-generated bulk code:** I do not accept massive, AI-generated PRs. Code must be human-readable, minimalistic, and match the existing project style.
3. **Pass the CI:** Make sure your code passes all strict type checks, linters, and tests. Run `pnpm check`, `pnpm check:submission`, and `pnpm test` locally before pushing.
4. **Keep it small:** PRs should be strictly focused on a single issue. 

Bug fixes and thoroughly discussed features are always welcome!
